      <h2 class="grid-span">Archetypes</h2>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <p>Azorious (U/W)</p>
      </button>
      <div class="archetype">
        <h5>Tokens</h5>
        <p>Blue/White looks to create and buff tokens, leveraging spells, creatures, and enchantments to swarm the
          board with tokens and give them evasion.</p>
        <h5>Birds</h5>
        <p>Take to the skies with birds and bird tokens. Fly over your opponent's pathetic blockers and ride your flock
          to victory!</p>
      </div>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <p>Dimir (U/B)</p>
      </button>
      <div class="archetype">
        <h5>Unblockable</h5>
        <p>Blue/Black features evasive creatures and ways to make them unblockable to facilitate ninjitsu and trigger
          effects that occur when your opponent takes combat damage.</p>
        <h5>Ninjas/Rogues</h5>
        <p>Sneak your ninjas and rogues into combat to trigger effects; slip by your opponent's blockers with trickery
          or evasion and they'll be dead before they know what hit them!</p>
      </div>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <p>Rakdos (B/R)</p>
      </button>
      <div class="archetype">
        <h5>Sacrifice</h5>
        <p>Black/Red views its creatures as expendable resources, sacrificing them to activate on death abilities and
          effects. Don't worry, you can always make more goblins!</p>
        <h5>Goblins</h5>
        <p>Go goblin mode by rallying an army of goblins, ripe for sacrifice, chump blocking, or going straight to your
          opponent's face!</p>
      </div>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <p>Gruul (R/G)</p>
      </button>
      <div class="archetype">
        <h5>Landfall</h5>
        <p>You have to play lands anyway, you might as well benefit from it! Red/Green can buff its creatures, make
          tokens, and draw cards just from playing lands.</p>
        <h5>Elementals</h5>
        <p>Connected the the earth, Elementals rise up from the ground, growing larger and more powerful with each land
          played. Make your land drops and trample over your opponents!</p>
      </div>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <p>Selesnya (G/W)</p>
      </button>
      <div class="archetype">
        <h5>+1/+1 Counters</h5>
        <p>What's better than casting creatures? Making them bigger! Green/White permanantly buffs its board through
          +1/+1 counters, and also adds bonuses to creatures that have counters.</p>
        <h5>Warriors</h5>
        <p>Warriors, come out to play! Build your rag-tag army up with +1/+1 counters and send them against your
          opponent!</p>
      </div>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <p>Orzhov (B/W)</p>
      </button>
      <div class="archetype">
        <h5>Reanimate</h5>
        <p>Put big stuff in the graveyard, then get it out for cheap. Black/White has a number of tools at its disposal
          so that you can get that 9-drop out on turn four!</p>
        <h5>Zombies</h5>
        <p>The dead rise from the grave with Black/White's tribe, creating tokens and using the zombie mob to overwhlem
          your foe!</p>
      </div>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <p>Izzet (U/R)</p>
      </button>
      <div class="archetype">
        <h5>Spell Slinging</h5>
        <p>In true Blue/Red fashion, this archetype looks to use instants and sorceries to trigger on cast effects and
          affect the board. Trigger prowess, make tokens, and more!</p>
        <h5>Wizards</h5>
        <p>Who better to cast spells than wizards? Use instants and sorceries to buff your wizards and draw cards,
          helping you find more spells!</p>
      </div>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <p>Golgari (B/G)</p>
      </button>
      <div class="archetype">
        <h5>Stuff Dying</h5>
        <p>In a typical game of Magic, creatures go to the graveyard. Black/Green uses death to its advantage to trigger
          on death effects. Get those things back from the graveyard and trigger those effects all over again!</p>
        <h5>Elves</h5>
        <p>One of Magic's classic tribes, elves can quickly snowball out of control due to their ability to generate
          mana, which, in turn, allows you to play more elves!</p>
      </div>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <p>Boros (R/W)</p>
      </button>
      <div class="archetype">
        <h5>Equipment</h5>
        <p>Red/White looks to suit up its creatures with equipment to make them pump damage through quickly. Cheap
          creatures with strong keywords can pack a punch with the right equipment!</p>
        <h5>Soldiers</h5>
        <p>Soldiers are often small, but can be powerful with equipment thanks to keywords like double strike and
          flying. Pump them up to blitz your opponent down!</p>
      </div>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <p>Simic (U/G)</p>
      </button>
      <div class="archetype">
        <h5>Shapeshifters</h5>
        <p>Why have an archetype when you can take everyone else's? Why have one tribe when you can be all of them?
          Blue/Green clones, shape-shifts, and steals its way to victory!</p>
